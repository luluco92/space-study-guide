# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This SPACE study guide was made for educational purposes. It was built because it was a homework assignment, but the nature of being an assignment itself does not ensure its fulfillment. It also requires motivation from the developer for it to reach the climactic culmination that it deserves.
Upon completion, this SPACE study guide has solved the hypothetical conundrum of what a student would have to do if they had forgotten specific lessons of the prework modules. Nobody wants to sift through 15 or 20 pages of lessons to find one specific piece of information. And I have learned the importance of making the first lesson easier rather than harder so that students can enter the boot camp with confidence instead of being intimidated by the sheer amount of information that they would eventually have to learn.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

To install this webpage download it from the internet.

## Usage

To use this webpage double click it in file folder.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well. I followed the boot camp tutorial to make this webpage happen.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/). This webpage uses the MIT license.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
